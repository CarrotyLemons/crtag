# Overview
- Investigate potential to tag folders (e.g. tagging control algorithms as Rust)
    - integration with shell script for sorting by tag
    - further specification for directory?
    - custom file format in directory to tag? it can tag the parent directory and any sibling directories/files?
    - nested tags (some tags encompass others)
    - attribute tagged tags (e.g. control algorithm can be tagged both math and programming)
    - sidecar files??!?
        - can be lost when original files move
        - would require all changes to be done through custom file mover that moves sidecar files as well
    - tagstudio stores the metadata internally
    - tags
        - name
        - shorthand
        - aliases
